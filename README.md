<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="about-the-project"> About The Project</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
  This repository aims to review of all the machine learning algorithms covered in the course INDE577 (Spring 2022), with the specific goals to:
  <ol> 
  <li> Clearly explaining the algorithm being implemented
  <li> Use exploratory analysis to understand the data being used
  <li> Identify types of problems and suitable algorithms
  <li> Conducting performance and error analysis
</ol>

<!-- DATASET -->
<h2 id="dataset"> Dataset</h2>

<p align="center">
</p>

<p> 
  There are two types of tasks that this course mainly cover: classification and regression. In classfication problems, the target variable is a categorical variable. The target can have two or more levels. Models' performances are usually measured by metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, area under the curve (AUC). In regression, the target variable is a continuous variable. Models' performances are usually measured by measures such as Mean Squared Error. 
  
  Two different datasets are used in this project, one is a classification problem, and another one is a regression problem.
  <ul>
    <li><b>Heart Disease Prediction</b>: Binary Classification Problem</li> 
    <br />
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for people of most races in the US. Common risk factors for heart diseass include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other key indicator include diabetic status, obesity (high BMI), not getting enough physical activity or drinking too much alcohol. Identifying these key risk factors is very important in healthcare. Machine learning methods are used to identify important factors to predict a patient's condition.This dataset contains 18 variables (9 booleans, 5 strings and 4 decimals). <br />
    <br />
The 'HeartDisease' variable has value of 'Yes' for respondents that have ever reported having coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infarction (MI). 
    <br />
    <br />
    <li><b>Academic Performance Prediction</b>: Regression Problem</li> 
    <br />
This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The dataset regarding the performance in Mathematics (mat) is used in this project. In the dataset, the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. The regression task here is to predict variable G2. Variable G3 is dropped, and G1 is included as an explanatory variable.

  </ul>
