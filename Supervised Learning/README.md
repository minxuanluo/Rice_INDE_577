<h2 align="center"> Introduction  </h2>  

Supervised learning is the types of machine learning for training data with labels. The labelled data means input data is already tagged with the correct output.

Supervised learning is a process of providing input data as well as correct output data to the machine learning model. Supervised machine learning models predict target (y) based on features (x).

In the real-world, supervised learning can be used for Risk Assessment, Image classification, Fraud Detection, spam filtering, etc.

There are basically 2 types of tasks for supervised learning, Regression and Classification. For regression, we can use algorithms such as linear regression, regression trees, svm regressor, etc. For classification, we can use many different algorithms, from the simplest logistic regression to very complex neural networks.
